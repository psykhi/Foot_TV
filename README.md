# Foot TV
Foot TV was an Android application showing french users on which channel the football games were broadcasted. The users could automatically add the games to their calendar and be reminded of its start. It also included a social feature where the users could directly see which games were the most anticipated by the other users of the app.

I developed both the application and the backend in PHP/mySQL.
